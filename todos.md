### Dataset changes

2. Add number of player positions known (estimation) based on last interactions (maybe shots fired last 5 seconds)

3. Maybe `cts_have_defuser` instead of total number

4. Time pressure as 1/t ?
5. Try a simpler xgboost with calibration to smooth some output
6. `cts_seen_recently` - how long ago someone shot

##### More ambitious:

`median_distance_to_bombsite`
