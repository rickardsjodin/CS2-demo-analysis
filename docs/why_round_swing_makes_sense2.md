### Why Round Swing (and Rating 3.0) is Misunderstood

At the start of a round with equal equipment, the win probability is roughly 50/50. If you get the opening kill, you shift that probability to your team's advantage—let's say, to 65%. For that, you are credited with the 15% difference. This is intuitive, and it makes sense to everyone.

But let's take a more extreme, counter-intuitive example. Imagine you're in a 1v5 with only a 1% chance of winning. Through a brilliant play, you bring it to a 1v1, which is roughly a 50/50 situation. So far, you have earned a whopping +49% round swing. But then, you lose to the last opponent. That final death is a -50% swing, leaving you with a net -1% for the round—exactly the same as if you had died instantly without a single kill.

This feels unfair, right? You might have dealt **400+ damage** and gotten four kills, yet you still end with a negative rating. Does that really make sense?

From the game's perspective, it does. You lost the round. Winning the match means winning rounds. Factoring out economic impact, it makes no difference to the final score whether you died instantly or took four opponents down with you. The enemy team gets a point on the board, and you get none. **The objective of the game is not to get kills; they are only a means to an end**. Round Swing is an excellent way of highlighting that.

If the final score was 13-7, a player's Round Swing score shows how much they contributed to that outcome. The fact that a 1v5 clutch almost happened doesn't change the scoreboard. I would be 13-7 regardless.

This is why 1v1s aren't "overpowered" by the metric; rather, their high value shows how incredibly important they are. Once a round comes down to a 1v1, it's all or nothing for the round win, and it's completely reasonable for the rating to reflect those high stakes.

Essentially, people are confusing two different questions:

1. Which players had the most raw output (kills, damage, etc.)?
2. Which players impacted the final score the most?

Both are interesting to know, and the first usually contributes to the second. The more output you have, the more likely you are to impact the game. But as shown above, this is not always the case. Sometimes raw output is completely inconsequential, and this is where the confusion arises—when these two metrics don't agree.

(This is where small sample-sizes play a part. As Harry (Author at HLTV) himself has said, over many games they will largely agree. But actually, I would argue, in small samples sizes a mismatch in output and impact can be **more** interesting, not less. It is here the Round Swing metric is offering a richer story of how a game was truly won or lost.)

Now, the million dollar question becomes: what should we value more — raw output or true impact? Is the 4k in a failed 1v5 attempt worth a positive rating, even though it meant nothing for the final score? Intuitively, many would say yes. But then again, getting frags is not the core objective of Counter-Strike. Do we not want the rating to purely reflect it's core objective?

Regardless of where you stand, the first step is to understand what the metric is actually measuring. Only then can we have a meaningful discussion about its value.

<!--
Rating 3.0's solution is to merge these two ideas into a single number. This, however, creates an inherent compromise, attempting to satisfy two different goals with one metric. This is also problematic. These two numbers have different units and different characteristics.

It forces us to consider the long-term direction of the rating systems. Are we in a transitional phase, moving toward a rating system that values only true impact through a refined Round Swing (maybe rather a "Match Swing" metric), or shall we keep trying to combine them both? Or even go backward a bit closer to a economy-adjusted 2.1?

But before we get there, the first step is a solid understanding of what Round Swing is and what it really measures. -->
