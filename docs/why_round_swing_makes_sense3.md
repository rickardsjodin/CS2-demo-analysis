#### Why Round Swing and Rating 3.0 is confusing.

I've seen alot of complaints about Rating 3.0 lately. A player have a really good game, but their rating is mediocre. It's a frustrating experience, and it makes it easy to dismiss the rating system. But the more I think about it, the more I realize the problem isn't that the rating is "wrong," but that we're often talking about two different things without realizing it.

Let's break it down by a counter-intuitive example. Imagine a player in a 1v5 with only a 1% chance of winning. The team is 7-12 down. Through a brilliant play, he brings it to a 1v1, which is roughly a 50/50 situation. So far, he has earned a whopping +49% round swing. But then, he dies to the last opponent. That final death is a -50% swing, leaving him with a net -1% for the round — exactly the same as if he had died instantly without a single kill.

This feels unfair, right? He might have dealt **400+ damage** and gotten four kills, yet still ends with a negative round swing score. But we, the viewers, saw a heroic performance. This is where the two philosophies clash.

##### Viewpoint #1: Measuring true impact

From this viewpoint, if the match ends 7-13, this rating answers the question: "How responsible was each player for that specific score?"

In our 1v5 example, the player's incredible effort ultimately did not add a point to their team's score. The round was lost. Therefore, from a pure impact perspective, the performance was inconsequential to the outcome. The match still would have ended with 7-13 regardless if he had output 400 damage or zero.

##### Viewpoint #2: Measuring Raw Performance (Who played the best?)

The alternative is to measure the quality of a player's actions, regardless of whether those actions were converted into a round win.

This view answers the question: "Which player demonstrated the highest level of skill and created the most opportunities?"

In our 1v5 example, the player's performance was a 10/10. They displayed world-class mechanics and game sense. They single-handedly created a massive opportunity out of nothing.

##### A soccer analogy

Let's make the difference even more clear with an analogy from a soccer game. Imagine a star player who is brilliant all game. They dribble past defenders, create multiple clear chances, and fires shots that unluckily smacks the goalpost. Their team loses 0-1. Their performance was world-class, but their impact on the final score was zero. This is our 1v5 hero. They did everything right, but a bit of bad luck or a single mistake at the end meant their brilliant output didn't convert.

Now, contrast this to a player who has a terrible game—bad passes, poor positioning—but the ball deflects off their shin and into the goal for a 1-0 win. Their performance was poor, but their impact was match-winning. Round Swing is designed to reward this player. It doesn't care how you played; it cares that your actions directly led to a win.

##### The Role of Sample Size (And Why a Mismatch is Interesting)

Now, over a large sample size—say, an entire tournament or a whole year—these two philosophies will almost always align. The player with the best raw performance will consistently convert that skill into impact and wins. The player who gets "lucky" goals won't be able to sustain it. But on a map-by-map basis, they can diverge wildly. And this is where Round Swing gets **more** interesting, not less. Instead of seeing a mismatch between performance and impact as a flaw in the rating, we can see it as a deeper insight in how the match was played. A high-performance, low-impact game tells us a player was brilliant but perhaps unlucky or couldn't get it over the line in the absolute key moments. It provides a richer, more detailed narrative of the match than if the two numbers were identical.

##### Where the Confusion Comes From

We instinctively expect a single rating number to tell us both stories at once. We want it to tell us who was most responsible for the win and who played the best. But as the examples show, those are sometimes two different players.
