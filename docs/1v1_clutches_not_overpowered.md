#### Why Round Swing 1v1 Clutches Are Not Overpowered

A common take is that 1v1 clutches are overrated in round swing and messes up the rating in low sample sizes. This is something Ner0 himself has said and it gets repeated over and over again when rating 3.0 is discussed.

The intuitive reaction is understandable: seeing a player get one, sometimes easy, kill and receive a larger rating boost than someone who fought for three kills earlier in the round can feel unbalanced. But this feeling comes from a mix-up between a player's performance and their ultimate impact.

Round swing isn't a "reward" for good plays. Think of it as a simple, objective description of what happened. It answers one question: "Which player had the most decisive say in the final score of this round?" It does not answer, "Who played the best?"

To make this distinction crystal clear, consider this scenario: The score is 7-12, and a player on the losing team is left in a 1v5. They put on an incredible display of skill, secure four kills, but narrowly lose the final duel. Despite this heroic performance, the score still becomes 7-13. From the perspective of the scoreboard, their impact was the same as if they had died instantly without a kill.

That player would receive the same low round swing score in both cases. Why? Because the rating isn't measuring their skill; it's describing the fact that they did not ultimately alter the outcome of the round.

This highlights the core idea behind round swing: it is intentionally blind to raw performance and focuses solely on impact. The player who wins a 1v1—no matter how messy or simple it was—is the main reason the round was won. Their high rating isn't an overvaluation; it's an accurate description of that fact.

So when it comes to the 1v1s and the "low sample size" argument, this is where, in my opinion, Round Swing gets more interesting, not less. Instead of seeing a mismatch between performance and impact as a flaw in the rating, we can see it as a deeper insight in how the match was played. A high-performance, low-impact game tells us a player was brilliant but perhaps unlucky or couldn't get it over the line in the absolute key moments. It provides a richer, more detailed narrative of the match than if the two numbers were identical.

We instinctively expect a single rating number to tell us both stories at once. We want it to tell us who was most responsible for the win and who played the best. But as the examples show, those are sometimes two different players.

This is precisely the tightrope Rating 3.0 tries to walk by merging these two concepts into one. But since a single number can't truly represent two different ideas, confusion is inevitable. This has led many to blame the counter-intuitive results on Round Swing itself. But this misses the point. The issue isn't that the concept of Round Swing is flawed—even if its current implementation has limits. The real takeaway is that "impact" and "performance" are separate things, and our analysis will only become clearer once we stop conflating the two.

So in essence: At low sample sizes, their difference can be bigger, while at higher sample sizes, the better performance players will get higher impact - since the better you perform, the higher likelyhood of impacting the outcome of the game. The descepancy at low sample sizes is a feature, not a bug.
