#### Why Round Swing 1v1 Clutches Are Not Overpowered

A common take is that 1v1 clutches are overrated in round swing and messes up the rating in low sample sizes. This is something @ner0 himself has said and it gets repeated over and over again when rating 3.0 is discussed.

The intuitive reaction is understandable: seeing a player get one, sometimes easy, kill and receive a larger rating boost than someone who fought for three kills earlier in the round can feel unbalanced. But this feeling comes from a mix-up between a player's performance and their ultimate impact.

Round swing isn't a "reward" for good plays. Think of it as a simple description of what happened. It answers the question: "Which players' actions had the most impact on the final outcome of the round?" It does not answer, "Who put in the most work in this round?"

To make this distinction crystal clear, consider this scenario: The score is 7-12, and a player on the losing team is left in a 1v5. They put on an incredible display of skill and secure four kills, but narrowly lose the final duel. Despite this heroic performance and outputting 400+ damage, the round was still lost. So even if he had died without a single kill and zero damage output, the final score would still have been 7-13. That player would receive the same low round swing score in both cases because the rating isn't measuring their skill; it's describing the fact that they did not ultimately alter the outcome of the round.

This highlights the core idea behind round swing: it is intentionally blind to raw performance and focuses solely on impact. The player who wins a 1v1—no matter how messy or simple it was—is the main single reason the round was won instead of lost. Their high rating isn't an overvaluation; it's a simple description of that fact.

So, when it comes to the "low sample size" argument, the mismatch between performance and impact isn't a flaw; it's an insight. A high-performance, low-impact game tells us a player was brilliant but couldn't convert in the key moments. Conversely, a player with "bad" K/D but high Round Swing tells us that he made those kills in key moments and did not put his team at a big disadvantage when dying. It provides a richer narrative than if the two numbers were always identical.

We instinctively want a single rating to tell us two stories at once: who was responsible for the win and who played the best. But as the examples show, those are sometimes two different players. People blame the counter-intuitive results on Round Swing and low sample size, but this misses the point. The issue isn't that the concept is flawed, but that "impact" and "performance" are separate things. At low sample sizes, their difference can be bigger, while over larger samples, the best-performing players will naturally have the highest impact.

Those discrepancies you see in a single game isn't a bug: it's a feature.
